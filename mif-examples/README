The examples are provided as integration tests. 

In order to run the example code, open MIFHttpRestClientIT and update the following attributes:
mifUserName - your system user name
mifUserPassword - your system user password
MIF_SHARE - a mount name of the MIF shared location (e.g. linux: /usr/global/mifshare or windows: X:/)
MIF_HOST - a name of the host running MIF
MIF_PORT - port number of the tomcat instance running MIF

Notes
The test running R assumes that the R executable used by SGE execution node is located under /opt/mango/R/2.13.1/bin/Rscript. You might need to update the path in shouldSubmitExecutionRequestToRConnectorPollAndWaitTillProcessingIsCompleted so it points to the correct location.
